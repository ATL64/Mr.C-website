# Mr.C Frontend for NLP application

This repository contains the code of the website we used for Mr.C.

Mr.C was a project where we used BERT (a language model) to be able to ask questions and retrieve the answer from the historical set of abstracts present in PubMed.

Developed together with Alejandro de Miquel who is a fantastic coder and scientist with great expertise in everything data related. You can see some of his awesome work here: https://github.com/alejandrodemiquel
