            About This Site
          </h3>
          <p>
            Mr. C (MRC stands for Machine Reading Comprehension) is a tool for answering
            questions based on scientific knowledge.
            If you ask a question, the algorithm will look for answers in all the
            abstracts of the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a>
            database.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that this is a project in early development stages.
            We are currently working in improving both the user interface and the
            performance of the algorithm.
          </p>
          <p>
            For an understanding and optimal use of this tool, please read carefully the
            following explanations.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Algorithm overview
          </h3>
          <p>
            When you ask a question, the algorithm will follow these steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li> Extract the keywords from the question</li>
            <li> Look for suitable abstracts in the PubMed database based on the keywords</li>
            <li> Ask your question to the selected abstracts using a Deep Learning algorithm</li>
            <li> Print two tables summarizing the answers found within the selected abstracts and pointing you at the relevant sources</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>
            Input Question
          </h3>
          <p>
            Your input needs to be a well formulated question, not a Google-like query.
            Ideally, it should be a question with potentially simple, short answers.
            Equal answers will be grouped together in the output; long answers extracted
            from different abstracts are unlikely to be equal, and won't be grouped with
            any others.
            The algorithm is currently bad at answering Yes/No questions. It only finds
            answers that can be found literally in abstracts. However, we are currently
            working on this kind of questions and expect to support them in the near
            future.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Output
          </h3>
          <p>
            The output consits of two tables: the answers table and the articles table.
            The answers table shows how many times each answer was found. Click on any
            row of that table to view the articles where that answer was found in the
            articles table. Click on any row of the articles table to view the complete
            abstract of that article.
            The scores shown in the articles table are the scores given by the Deep
            Learning algorithm. The higher the score, the more confident it is that the
            answer is correct. We only select answers with a score of 3 or more.
            Typically, a score of above 10 tends to be reasonably good.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Performance
          </h3>
          <p>
            Due to the nature of state-of-the-art question-answering algorithms,
            the inference time is high.
            With the current settings, it takes roughly one second to analyse 4 abstracts.
            Therefore, if you ask to obtain answers for 100 abstracts, which is what we
            recommend, but also the maximum that we currently allow, you should expect to
            have to wait for about half a minute until you obtain your results.
            In some extreme cases the whole workflow might take up to one minute.
            If the extracted keywords appear in many abstracts, the articles that you
            are looking for might not be chosen to be analysed. Thus, we encourage you to
            be as specific as possible in your question.
          </p>
          <p>
            Requests can only be processed one at a time, meaning that if you ask a
            question and someone else just made a request, your request might take longer
            than usual or be rejected.
            You should be able to view the amount of requests that are currently in the
            queue at all times.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are regularly working on performance improvements, but the main way to
            significantly improve the workflow is by increasing our hardware resources.
            Using GPUs and multiple machines to parallelize the incoming requests could
            dramatically speed the process up, and would also allow us to use better models
            that would provide us with improved answers.
            This would be feasible and relatively easy to implement, but such resources
            are costly, and we currently cannot afford to have them.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Known Issues
          </h3>
          <p>
            There are several issues with the current state of the tool we are aware of.
            We are planning to work on them to potentially fix them all. The main ones
            are:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The performance issues mentioned in the previous section.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ability to answer yes/no questions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some answers should clearly be grouped together, but they are not.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some answers are clearly not relevant or false.
              </li>
            </ul>
            If you find any issue that is not mentioned in the list above, want to point
            us a particular example, or have any other suggestion, please contact us by
            via the 'Contact' tab or by sending an email to hello@sciencemrc.com.

          <h3>
            Data Tracking Disclaimer
          </h3>
          <p>
            We are keeping track of the every question asked.
            In particular, for every question asked we store the user id, the question
            asked, the other parameters specified by the user, the date, the answers and
            details about the execution time.
            The user id corresponds to a random, unique identifier that we have generated
            in order to anonimize the results.
            We do this with the sole purpose of better understanding how the algorithm
            performs and the actions that we can take in order to improve it.
