This repository contains the code of the website we used for Mr.C.
Mr.C was a project where we used BERT (a language model) to be able to ask questions and retrieve the answer from the historical set of abstracts present in PubMed.

Developed together with Alejandro de Miquel https://github.com/alejandrodemiquel
